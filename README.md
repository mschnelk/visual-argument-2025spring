For my visual argument, I decided to focus on the importance of reading and the effects it can have on your mental health. 
I want to juxtapose a gloomy outdoors with the bright setting of a fantasy novel inside the subjects room. Although this idea
is not set in stone, and might change, I do hope to get across that reading is an importance and effective way to take care
of your brain, especially during winter times. This is a sketch I made for the basic idea, but hopefully the final product looks better.
