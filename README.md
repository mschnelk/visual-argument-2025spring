<h2> Visual Argument </h2>

I decided on a completely different message that I want to portray. I switched away from reading, and instead want to focus on the importance of
staying present. Specifically, being in nature or "the real world" instead of being stuck on your devices and falling into traps of social media. 

There a number of reasons I decided to switch. For one, not everyone understands the effect reading has on people, and although I do believe
is great for your mental health, it's not an issue I'm passionate about. Also, I wasn't exactly sure how I'd be able to get the idea across through my visual argument. 

So instead, during study time in class, I searched through some images to find ones that spoke to me or inspired me to create something, and stumbled upon a photo of 
a beautiful forest. This definitley sparked my interest because (as stated previously in my audio narrative), I love the outdoors, and similar to my original plan, spending time 
outside and away from your phones can be healing for you mind and soul. 

My new idea is to have someone falling into a hole in the forest which leads to a void of phones and reaching hands with notifications of news headlines and messages from social media platforms. 
I want to depict them clinging to the ground, trying not to fall in. This will be juxtaposed with text that says "Stay Grounded." 

This is my redrawn design.

Now that I had a solid idea that I was happy with and passionate about, I got to work on the project. However, most of my time was spend trying to decide on the design, so I would be able to decide which images I needed. My current file, which is clearly far from complete, is the my current attempt at creating the shape and idea of the hole that goes falls towards the void. I wanted to show roots hanging off from the trees, but did not get a file that was very compatible for the forest one I chose. My next step will be making the background as cohesive as possible, so when I add in the subjects, the background won't be distracting from the message.

For my visual argument, I decided to focus on the importance of reading and the effects it can have on your mental health. 
I want to juxtapose a gloomy outdoors with the bright setting of a fantasy novel inside the subjects room. Although this idea
is not set in stone, and might change, I do hope to get across that reading is an importance and effective way to take care
of your brain, especially during winter times. This is a sketch I made for the basic idea, but hopefully the final product looks better.
